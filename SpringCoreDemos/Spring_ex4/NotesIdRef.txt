3.3.3.1.1. The idref element

The idref element is simply an error-proof way to pass the id of another 
bean in the container (to a <constructor-arg/> or <property/> element).
<bean id="theTargetBean" class="..."/>

<bean id="theClientBean" class="...">
    <property name="targetName">
        <idref bean="theTargetBean" />
    </property>
</bean>
The above bean definition snippet is exactly equivalent (at runtime) to the following snippet:
<bean id="theTargetBean" class="..."/>

<bean id="client" class="...">
    <property name="targetName">
        <value>theTargetBean</value>
    </property>
</bean>
The main reason the first form is preferable to the second is that using the
 idref tag allows the container to validate at deployment time that the referenced
 , named bean actually exists. In the second variation, no validation is performed
  on the value that is passed to the 'targetName' property of the 'client' bean. 
  Any typo will only be discovered (with most likely fatal results) when the 
  'client' bean is actually instantiated. If the 'client' bean is a prototype
   bean, this typo (and the resulting exception) may only be discovered long 
   after the container is actually deployed.
Additionally, if the bean being referred to is in the same XML unit, and the 
bean name is the bean id, the 'local' attribute may be used, which allows 
the XML parser itself to validate the bean id even earlier, at XML document
 parse time.
<property name="targetName">
   <!-- a bean with an id of 'theTargetBean' must exist,
                otherwise an XML exception will be thrown -->
   <idref local="theTargetBean"/>
</property>
