Java components / classes should be as independent as possible of other Java
classes. This increases the possibility to reuse these classes and to test
them independently of other classes(Unit Testing). To decouple Java components
from other Java components the dependency to a certain other class should get
injected into them rather that the class itself creates / finds this object.
